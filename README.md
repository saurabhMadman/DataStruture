WhaT Linear Data Struture Is?
A data structure with homogeneous elements is linear if it organizes its elements 
into a sequence. In a computer, each data structure is fInite in terms of the number
of its elements. A linear data structure has a fust and a last element. Each of the
other elements in the linear data structure has a predecessor and a successor.

There are several ways to represent the predecessor-successor relation for a
linear data structure in a computer. An array is a linear data structure. An array
maps its elements to contiguous words in memory. We can access the elements
with their indexes in the array. The organization of an array matches the random
access pattern of computer memory. The indexed access of an array element is
fast. The access of each element takes a fIxed amount of time. We regard the cost
of array element access as constant, i.e., the time required is 0(1).
